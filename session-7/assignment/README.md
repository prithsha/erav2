# Assignment - 7

## Step-1 Model

Included sub-steps:
- Setup
- Basic Skeleton
- Lighter model
- Batch Normalization

File name: assignment_7_model_1.ipynb

Targets:
- Model parameters nearly 7k
- Test accuracy more than 99.2 %
- Setup basic code with transition and max pooling block
- Adding batch normalization in each convolution layer

Results:
- Total params: 6666
- Maximum test accuracy: 99.10%
- Maximum train accuracy : 99.52%

Analysis:
- Model does not seems to be over fitting
- Test accuracy not increasing, infact it started decreasing after epoch-10
- Need to reduce model parameters and kernel size of 7 at last layer
